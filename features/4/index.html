      <h3> What data can tell us about solving the cube efficiently and
        fast</h3>
      <p align="justify"> Solving the cube as a craft&nbsp; has evolved
        over the past 40 years and as people have studied and trained to
        solve it ever faster, a body of knowledge has started to take
        shape. The past 10 years have seen the time necessary to solve
        the cube plunge to a handful of seconds, while the amount of
        know-how has skyrocketed. A body of data has started to form, as
        databases of algorithms, but also reconstructions of eminent
        solves have been gathered into repositories for the cubing
        community. Foremost among these, www.speedcubedb.com now
        comprises thousands of algorithms for many puzzles and events,
        and several thousands of solves by the fastest cubers in the
        world.</p>
      <h3> It is hard to overstate the amount of work behind this data<br>
      </h3>
      <p> This work, and this article would not have seen light were it
        not for the herculean work of a number of people in the cubing
        community, it is worth mentioning 3 of them. Heading the solve
        reconstruction effort, <b><b>Stuart Clark</b> </b>not only
        reconstructs the vast majority of all new solves, to the tune of
        hundreds of solves per month,&nbsp; but he manages and nudges
        the main efforts of the reconstruction community. The
        torchbearer mantle was passed onto him by the original
        reconstruction god, <b><b>Brest</b>,</b> who single-handedly
        reconned half of the four thousands solves available at the time
        of this writing. Closing this holy triumvirate is <b><b>Gil
            Zussman</b>,</b> who not only created, designed and coded <a
          moz-do-not-send="true" href="http://speedcubedb.com/">speedcubedb.com</a>
        and <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://cubedb.net/">cubedb.net</a>
        (both formidable feats of technological craftiness) but
        developed a plethora of tools for solve reconstruction, alg
        discovery and management, that make the life of speedcubers the
        world over so much easier and better.<br>
        And finally thanks to Anto, Ben, Feliks and Phillip for going
        over a pre-read of this and for their insightful feedback.<br>
      </p>
      <br>
      <b>And with that out of the way, let's see what we found out in
        the data</b><br>
      <br>
      <img moz-do-not-send="true" src="/features/4/th-scdb-stats.jpg" alt="scdb-stats"

      <br>
      <font size="+1"><i>In this multi-part series of articles we will
          dig into this data to see what we can learn from the fastest
          solvers and their fastest solves.</i></font>

		  <br>
		  <br>
      <h2>You can't be super-fast AND super-efficient<br>
      </h2>
      <h3>At some point, higher TPS is only possible at the cost of
        efficiency<br>
      </h3>
      <img moz-do-not-send="true" src="/features/4/times-vs-tps.jpg" alt="times vs tps" width="600" height="365"> <br>
		<p>When we combine the solve time
      with the turns per second (TPS) of the solver, and the number of
      moves to solve the cube, we're struck by two things: While there
      is a relatively linear relationship between times and TPS until we
      hit about 8 seconds, the times hit a wall even though very-high
      TPS can still happen. Conversely, while the average number of
      moves per solve decreases slowly until about the same time, it
      takes a sharp downward turn for the faster solves. So far so good.
      However, when we look at solve moves vs TPS we realise that there
      are very few solves that have both very low moves and very high
      tps, whereas there are many more that have only one of them. This
      suggests that – for the time being – it is not really possible to
      find efficient solutions while going very fast.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Roteto rotato, more complex move-set or more rotations?<br>
      </h2>
      <h3>Fueling the fire of the high-gen vs rotate debate<br>
      </h3>
      <div align="center"><img moz-do-not-send="true"  src="/features/4/rotate-vs-gen.png" alt="th-rotate-vs-gen" width="600"  height="328"><br>
        <br>
        <br>
      </div>
      <p>It is rare to have clear-cut answers, for once this looks like
      one. Solves with cross rotations are 5.5x slower than crosses with
      equivalent move-count that increase the complexity of the movement
      set (n-gen). This is likely due to the fact that inspection allows
      to prepare and adjust to the more complex fingertricks necessary
      to operate on several cube axes.</p>
      <p>The opposite is true for f2l, where the much higher tps (2/3
      faster than cross tps on average) means that spamming low-gen
      moves whilst incurring rotations is a successful strategy,
      regardless of whether we move from 2-gen to 3 or from 3 to 4.</p>
      <p>The desire for no-rotation methods (which made sense when
      fingetricks were vastly more limited by cube hardware, and TPS was
      by necessity much lower) might not be that relevant anymore.
      </p>
      <h2>Solve pairs in the back first, and don't get too fancy with
        your inserts<br>
      </h2>
      <h3>BR slot for first pair is the most frequent go-to option for
        the fastest solves<br>
      </h3>
      <div align="center"><img moz-do-not-send="true" src="/features/4/f2lPairs.png"  alt="F2l Pair slot by solve time" width="600" height="506"><br><br><br>
      </div>
      <p>The Back-Right slot is the most used for the first f2l pair, and
      it's usage is more frequent the faster the solve. Last slot tends
      to end on Front-Right more than half of the time, but Back-Right
      is also an option that gets some usage. That is not to say that
      the other slots aren't used at all, they still account for between
      1/6 and 1/4 of slot usages. But the habit of slotting things in
      the back still comes out as a winning one.</p>
      <h3>The vast majority of inserts are very vanilla<br>
      </h3>
      <img moz-do-not-send="true" src="/features/4/f2l-insertions.jpg" alt="F2l
        Insertions" width="600" height="295"><br><br><br>
		<p>
      95% of pair insertions use standard RU/LU insertions, foregoing
      the more complex FRUF or wide-move insertions (slice-move inserts
      didn't even make the graph, but you can find them below). This has
      some validity – wide-move insertions are slower than the others –
      but not only, as F-based ones are just as fast if not slightly
      faster, than vanilla. They're just not used much.<br>
      Keyhole (the fastest insert on average) is very rare, and appears
      mostly for the first couple of pairs, while edge-controlling F
      inserts (e.g. sledge) appear mostly (and unsurprisingly) for last
      pair.</p>
      <h2>S pls, or actually don't. Save it for OLL</h2>
      <h3>The zoomer excitement for S moves everywhere might be a bit
        premature</h3>
      <img moz-do-not-send="true" src="/features/4/step-execution-by-move.jpg"
        alt="step-execution-by-move" width="600" height="301"> <br><br><br>
		<p>The
      relatively recent improvements in cube hardware technology, have
      made the execution of non-M slice viable during solves, and their
      usage has gain some traction, especially in the younger community.
      Whilst we know that M slices have their place in a solve (the
      fastest OLL and PLL algs demonstrate this easily), the same is not
      clear for S and E slices. When solvers utilise them in any step
      except OLL, those steps will be significantly slower than when
      using their outer-layer variant.</p>
	  <p>With that being said, our data reflects the performance of current
      top-level solvers, who have learned their ropes in an earlier less
      slice-heavy era. It might be that with time the advantages given
      by these "new" moves (previously less viable due to hardware
      limitations) might come to the fore. However, the fact that S
      moves have quickly found their place in OLL but not in others
      indicates that if they presented a stark improvement on
      alternative moves those might have come to light already. The
      prominence of "simple works better" instances especially in f2l
      would suggest slices might not be the way to go for at least some
      of the cfop phases.</p>
      <h2>Nope, dot-OLLs are just fine<br>
      </h2>
      <h3>While the exec time of dot OLLs is slightly longer, any
        attempt to avoid them is worse<br>
      </h3>
      <img moz-do-not-send="true" src="/features/4/th-oll-exec.jpg" alt="oll exec"
        width="600" height="269"> <br><br><br>
		
		<p>Oll executions require a rather wide
      range of time in general, but it true that the median execution
      for Dot OLLs is slightly slower than other OLLs (by about
      0.16sec). This doesn't seem to affect solves overall: the median
      solve containing a Dot OLL sits evenly in-between solves with OCLL
      and those with other cases. What's more, any attempt to influence
      EO through last slot will lose you more time than the expected
      gain in time. So just learn good algs, and don't worry about dot
      OLLs.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>What about XCrosses, AUFs, PLLs, Skips?<br>
      </h2>
      There's plenty more, too much to put onto a single article. If
      you're looking for more, check out the whole analysis. <font
        color="#666666"><a moz-do-not-send="true"

      <br>
      Understandably most of our efforts have been dedicated to
      analyzing CFOP solves for now. However Stewy and his minions have
      been churning out reconstructions for other methods (Roux chief
      among them, but others as well!) which will be the focus of our
      coming work.<br>
      <h3>Some caveats on the data:</h3>
      By construction this data is selecting mainly great solves from
      top-level cubers. This means that luck plays a role (especially in
      the fastest solves), otherwise the solve would simply not be part
      of this data. A better approach would be to conduct
      solver-specific analysis and normalize by the solver median times,
      but this will require much more data on individual solvers (right
      now we have only a handful of people with more than 50 solves
      each). We're working towards this ; ).<br>
